Abstract

Ecological light pollution, defined by its ability to alter the patterns of night and day in an ecosystem, is a relatively recent disturbance from an evolutionary perspective (Longcore & Rich, 2004). Before two hundred years ago the moon and the stars were the major sources of light at night. By burning wood, oil, dried fish and other materials alike, fire was the main source of artificial light. While certainly influencing local animal behavior and ecology, such effects were limited. Since then, the proliferation of electric lighting has revolutionised the way the world is seen today. At the flick of a switch or press of a button, the patterns of night and day that used to govern early human behavior can now be controlled.
