While out in San Francisco, I was lucky enough to be introduced to a VC. For a long time I had admired their job, can you imagine investing in startups for your living? Here is what I learnt but first some background.

It all started when I went to a comedy gig in San Francisco and I started talking to a girl. Next thing you know, I get a tap on the shoulder from a guy who tells me he's her husband! I awkwardly introduce myself and next thing he's buying me rounds of beers. Turns out this guy founded a startup that treats the same toxin you get from a hangover. He also has investors and would like to introduce them to me. Not thinking much about these drunk promises, I go home satisfied with my bizzare night.

A few months later I received an email introduction to his VC â€“ a guy I'll call John who had invested in 60 startups that year! We go out for lunch and afterwards he even lets me sit in on a shark tank like session where 2 startups pitched to a board of venture capitalists.

I learnt that there is only so much information you can infer from a pitch. A large part of the decision to invest is based on not what is said, or even the idea, but how you speak and the way you react. I was lucky to have met John, who played the role of a calm, rational good cop because there was one VC who was brutal in his attacks. He was basically telling the startups that their idea was stupid and they had essentially wasted the last few years of their life. It seemed to me however, that underneath this was a calculated intent to make the entrepreneurs feel uncomfortable. To see how they would react under pressure.
