Most important thing is to do it yourself. Cheap flights can be found by comparing different travel routes on 2-3 travel sites. Some good ones are skyscanner and momondo. Look for alternative ways to get places â€“ some of these pathways have created my favourite travelling experiences! For example, on our way back from Japan to New Zealand it was cheaper to book a layover in fiji and we could extend it from 24 hours to 3 days. Even cheaper than flying from Japan to Fiji!
